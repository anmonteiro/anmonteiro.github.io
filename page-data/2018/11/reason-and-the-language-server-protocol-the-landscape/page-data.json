Despite what their names might suggest, all of them support both\nOCaml and Reason. Their goals and tradeoffs are described below.</p>\n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://github.com/freebroccolo/ocaml-language-server\"><code class=\"language-text\">ocaml-language-server</code></a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/freebroccolo/ocaml-language-server\"><code class=\"language-text\">ocaml-language-server</code></a>\nis the first implementation of an LSP server to have appeared for OCaml / Reason\nand made a few compromises in the name of shipping quickly and iterating fast:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is implemented in TypeScript, and makes use of the upstream <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node\">LSP\nimplementation\nlibrary</a> by Microsoft\nfor Node.js</li>\n<li>\n<p>It makes extensive use of existing tools for functionality such as code\nformatting, autocompletion and type information reporting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>These include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ocaml/merlin\">Merlin</a><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><sub><a\nhref=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sub></sup> for code diagnostics, completion and\ntype information reporting;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent\"><code class=\"language-text\">ocp-indent</code></a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/reason\"><code class=\"language-text\">refmt</code></a> for OCaml and Reason code\nformatting, respectively;</li>\n<li>Calls to the underlying build systems and package managers, including\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript\">BuckleScript</a>, the OCaml\n/ Reason to JavaScript compiler.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredly/reason-language-server\"><code class=\"language-text\">reason-language-server</code></a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jaredly/reason-language-server\"><code class=\"language-text\">reason-language-server</code></a> is\na new implementation of the Language Server Protocol that is implemented in\nReason and compiled to native code. It makes another set of trade-offs, which\nare detailed below, and is the implementation that will be covered in this\nseries of posts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It reduces the reliance on external tools such as Merlin –\n<code class=\"language-text\">reason-language-server</code> implements its own type information reporting and\nsource code diagnostics.</li>\n<li>Given it is written in Reason and compiled to native code,\n<code class=\"language-text\">reason-language-server</code> has implemented its own LSP protocol communication\ninfrastructure because there wasn't one yet in the OCaml ecosystem.</li>\n<li>It also includes support for\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bsansouci/bsb-native\"><code class=\"language-text\">bsb-native</code></a>, a fork of\nBuckleScript that can build OCaml and Reason projects to OCaml bytecode and\nnative assembly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting up Reason in <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a></h2>\n<p>The first editor that we are going to cover in this series is also the simplest\none to set up. The following instructions assume that you have a working <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual\nStudio Code</a> installation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Open VS Code and select the extensions panel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Look for the <code class=\"language-text\">reason-vscode</code> package by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaredforsyth\">Jared\nForsyth</a> as seen in the following image<sup\nid=\"fnref:2\"><sub><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sub></sup>.</p>\n<div style=\"margin:30px\">\n  <img style=\"max-width:50%;margin:0 auto\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/661909/48666415-3e4ec880-eab9-11e8-84b9-1e0beb28f95e.png\">\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click \"Install\", wait until it finishes and click the \"Reload\" button to\nreload the workspace and apply your changes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The above should be all you need! From now on, whenever you open a Reason or\nOCaml file you'll see the Reason Language Server in action: beyond the syntax\nhighlighting provided by the extension, you'll see type hinting and error\ninformation if that is the case. Please open an\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jaredly/reason-language-server/issues/new/choose\">issue</a> in\nReason Language Server in case anything has gone wrong.</p>\n<h2>Parting Thoughts and Next Posts</h2>\n<p>This post briefly covered the landscape of Language Server Protocol\nimplementations in OCaml and Reason, as well as the tradeoffs each one embraces\nand the differences between them.</p>\n<p>Next time we'll be covering how to set up the Reason LSP integration for Emacs.\nPlease tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_anmonteiro\">@_anmonteiro</a> with any\nquestions or feedback about this post.</p>\n<p>Happy hacking!</p>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"fn:1\">\n  <sup><sub>1</sub></sup> <sub>Merlin is an editor service that implements\n  modern IDE features for OCaml and Reason.
