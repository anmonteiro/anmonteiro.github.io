On the 6th of September, I had the pleasure to speak at [Full Stack Fest 2016](https://2016.fullstackfest.com/)
in Barcelona. The talk has been recorded and you can find a link to the video below.

This talk was a slightly different version of the one I gave
[earlier this year]({% post_url 2016-05-14-clients-in-control-om-next-craft-conf-2016 %})
in Budapest. I also gave it the same title: *"Clients in control: building demand-driven
systems with Om Next"*. It touches on the motivation for Om Next's appearance, its
influences in the JavaScript world, and the bits and pieces that make it stand out
from its counterparts.

The target of this talk was a general audience (mostly JavaScript developers), so
I couldn't go too much into Clojure-y specifics.

You can watch a video of it below. I've also published the
[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/anmonteiro/clients-in-control-building-demand-driven-systems-with-om-next-1).
