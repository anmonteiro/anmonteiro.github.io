For sometime around last year, I had been toying with a simple [isitup.org](https://isitup.org/) API client and command line tool in Clojure. Just until a few days ago, it was just sitting in [my GitHub page](https://github.com/anmonteiro). Until I decided to put it out there.

So `clj-isitup` is out there now, both on  [GitHub](https://github.com/anmonteiro/clj-isitup) and in [Clojars](https://clojars.org/clj-isitup). It is working pretty well, but it still needs some polishing around the corners, such as its own [command line executable](https://github.com/anmonteiro/clj-isitup/issues/3) (for now you can try it out via `lein run` or `lein trampoline`).

Go ahead then, and you too toy with it. Feel free to report any issues or add your own thoughts in the comments below.
