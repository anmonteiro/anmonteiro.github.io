At the end of April, I gave a talk about Om Next at [Craft Conf](http://craft-conf.com/) in Budapest. The talk was recorded and the link is below.

*"Clients in control: building demand-driven systems with Om Next"* is what I decided to call it. It touches on the motivation for the appearance of systems like Falcor, Relay and Om Next, and presents a high-level overview of the ideas and implementation behind Om Next. The talk was targeted at a general audience, so I didn't go too much into Clojure(Script) specific parts. You can watch it in [here](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86179814).

At the end of my talk, I was gifted the piece below. What a lovely gift! I really loved the gesture.
