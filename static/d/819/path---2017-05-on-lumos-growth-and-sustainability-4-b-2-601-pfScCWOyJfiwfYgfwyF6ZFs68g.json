And\nwhile it may not sound like such, this is a very good thing. Going forward, I\npredict the following are immediate needs that Lumo has.</p>\n<h2>Project's goals</h2>\n<h3>Creating thorough documentation and develop a website</h3>\n<p>Lumo needs a website. And some documentation. This has been on my todo list for\na long time and I feel like we need to tackle it sooner rather than later. There\nare costs associated with registering a domain name and hosting a website, along\nwith all the effort of developing the webpage and writing all the documentation.</p>\n<h3>Have a logo designed</h3>\n<p>Given Lumo's current popularity, I believe having a logo designed aligns with the\nproject's direction and would love to have this done when launching a website.</p>\n<h3>Sort out CI issues</h3>\n<p>Lumo has been having some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_anmonteiro/status/852623330708410369\">CI issues</a>.\nWhile this has been solved short term, I'm fairly confident they will start showing\nup again as more features are added, and that we will need to host our own continuous\nintegration service at some point in the future.</p>\n<h3>Lumo build API</h3>\n<p>Lumo can currently build very simple\n<a href=\"2017/02/compiling-clojurescript-projects-without-the-jvm\">ClojureScript projects with optimizations</a>.\nBringing the Lumo build API and compiler toolchain to feature parity with the\nregular JVM ClojureScript compiler is a goal that I believe warrants great benefits\nto ClojureScript's reach.</p>\n<h3>Even more</h3>\n<p>There is even more stuff in the pipes. Getting Lumo to work on the Raspberry Pi,\nfor one, is a big short term goal. Supporting more platforms and 32-bit architectures\nis another that is potentially related to CI issues. Even more features are the\ndevelopment of idiomatic ClojureScript I/O, shell and HTTP wrappers for Node.js's\nAPIs, getting Lumo on more package managers, and eventually tackling dependency\nmanagement and resolution.</p>\n<h2>Today</h2>\n<p>Today I'm launching an initiative to ensure the steady growth and long term\nviability of Lumo. I've opened an <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/lumo\">OpenCollective</a>\npage for Lumo where you can pledge your support for the project. You can choose\nto become a backer or a sponsor. Contributions can be one time, monthly or yearly,\nand in the amount you choose (as little as $1!). Companies can become sponsors too.</p>\n<p>Note that contributions are not meant to be for myself only. Any contributor that\ndevotes a substantial amount of time to working on a Lumo feature can choose to\nsubmit an expense to the project's funding.</p>\n<h3>Why Open Collective?</h3>\n<p>Open Collective' core value is transparency in contributions. This means that you\nwill always be able to see what the contributions your pledge are being used for.\nOpen Collective also lets project maintainers automatically issue invoices, so if\nyou need one (typically as a sponsor company) the process is very straightforward\nfor both parts. You can also cancel your sponsorship any time you'd like.</p>\n<h3>What do sponsors get?</h3>\n<p>Now, as a potential sponsor to Lumo, you must be asking what is it that you get\nfor contributing to Lumo's Open Collective initiative. As a sponsor, you get\nseveral benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>as a sponsor, your company's logo displayed in the project's README for every visitor to see</li>\n<li>I will also take your input into consideration and you'll have a say in helping\nsteer Lumo's goals</li>\n<li>you will impact the speed at which new features are developed into Lumo's codebase.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Parting thoughts</h2>\n<p>This initiative represents a lot to Lumo's viability going forward. I urge you to\nconsider backing or sponsoring Lumo to ensure its growth. Even if you don't back\nthe project, I would be extremely grateful if you could share this post and / or\nthe <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/lumo\">Lumo Open Collective page</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>","fields":{"title":"On Lumo's Growth and Sustainability","date":"01 May 2017","tags":["clojure","clojurescript","lumo"],"slug":"/2017/05/on-lumos-growth-and-sustainability/","url":"https://anmonteiro.com/2017/05/on-lumos-growth-and-sustainability/"}},"allPosts":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"title":"Reason and the Language Server Protocol: The Landscape","slug":"/2018/11/reason-and-the-language-server-protocol-the-landscape/","tags":["reason","ocaml","emacs","editors"],"date":"17 Nov 2018"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"The State of ClojureScript Compilation in Lumo","slug":"/2017/09/the-state-of-clojurescript-compilation-in-lumo/","tags":["clojure","clojurescript","lumo"],"date":"19 Sep 2017"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"Shipping a (very simplistic) ReasonReact app","slug":"/2017/08/shipping-a-very-simplistic-reasonreact-app/","tags":["reason","ocaml"],"date":"20 Aug 2017"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"On Lumo's Growth and Sustainability","slug":"/2017/05/on-lumos-growth-and-sustainability/","tags":["clojure","clojurescript","lumo"],"date":"01 May 2017"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"Requiring Node.js modules from ClojureScript namespaces","slug":"/2017/03/requiring-node-js-modules-from-clojurescript-namespaces/","tags":["clojure","clojurescript","node","nodejs"],"date":"17 Mar 2017"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"Compiling ClojureScript Projects Without the JVM","slug":"/2017/02/compiling-clojurescript-projects-without-the-jvm/","tags":["clojure","clojurescript","lumo"],"date":"21 Feb 2017"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"The fastest Clojure REPL in the world","slug":"/2016/11/the-fastest-clojure-repl-in-the-world/","tags":["clojure","clojurescript","lumo"],"date":"09 Nov 2016"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"ClojureScript `require` outside `ns`","slug":"/2016/10/clojurescript-require-outside-ns/","tags":["clojure","clojurescript"],"date":"02 Oct 2016"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"Om Next internals: Incremental Rendering","slug":"/2016/09/om-next-internals-incremental-rendering/","tags":["clojure","clojurescript","om"],"date":"29 Sep 2016"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"Om Next Server-Side Rendering","slug":"/2016/09/om-next-server-side-rendering/","tags":["clojure","clojurescript","om"],"date":"15 Sep 2016"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"Om Next at Full Stack Fest 2016","slug":"/2016/09/om-next-at-full-stack-fest-2016/","tags":["talks","clojure","clojurescript","om"],"date":"14 Sep 2016"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"Om Next and Bootstrapped ClojureScript","slug":"/2016/08/om-next-and-bootstrapped-clojurescript/","tags":["clojure","clojurescript","om"],"date":"24 Aug 2016"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"ClojureScript `require` now supports `:rename`","slug":"/2016/08/clojurescript-require-now-supports-rename/","tags":["clojure","clojurescript"],"date":"10 Aug 2016"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"The quest for a unified routing solution in Om Next","slug":"/2016/06/the-quest-for-a-unified-routing-solution-in-om-next/","tags":["clojure","clojurescript","om"],"date":"12 Jun 2016"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"title":"&apos;Clients in control&apos;
